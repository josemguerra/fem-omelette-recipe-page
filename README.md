## My process

### Useful resources

- [Semantic HTML](https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand semantic HTML tags. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [BEM Methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN (ARIA)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)
- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This complete guide explains everything about flexbox, focusing on all the different possible properties for the parent element (the flex container) and the child elements (the flex items).
- [Schemas.org](https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) - A collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data.
- [The Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/) - The Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph.

### Features

- **Semantic HTML:** The page uses semantic HTML tags to enhance readability and accessibility.
- **Responsive Design:** Adaptable to various screen sizes using CSS media queries.
- **Accessible Content:** Includes ARIA roles and attributes, Open Graph meta tags for social media sharing, and SEO-friendly descriptions.
- **Structured Data:** Incorporates schema.org microdata to provide structured information about the recipe (e.g., ingredients, nutrition, cooking time).
- **Custom Styling:** Styled with Google Fonts and a custom CSS file.

### Highlights

- Preparation time, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.
- Nutritional information table.
- Fully optimized for accessibility and SEO.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page (using a separate stylesheet).
- **Google Fonts**: For custom typography (Outfit and Young Serif).
- **Open Graph Protocol**: For enhancing social media link previews.
- **schema.org**: For structured data to improve search engine visibility.

### Benefits

- **Search Engine Optimization**: The microdata ensures search engines can understand the content better, improving its ranking and rich snippets.
